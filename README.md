# Face Recognition System

This project aims to implement a robust face recognition system using MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks) and Face-Net from Pytorch. The core functionality includes face detection, feature extraction, and identification of individuals based on their facial features.

## Introduction

Face recognition technology is increasingly being used in various applications such as security, authentication, and social media. This project leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models to provide accurate and efficient face recognition capabilities.

### Face Detection vs. Face Recognition

Face Detection and Face Recognition are distinct yet complementary processes in the realm of computer vision and biometrics:


- **Face Detection:** 
    - **Objective:** To identify and locate faces within an image or video.
    - **Functionality:** It involves detecting the presence of faces and drawing bounding boxes around them. It does not involve identifying or recognizing who the faces belong to.
    - **Use Cases:** Surveillance systems, camera focus, facial landmark detection, and as a preliminary step for face recognition.

- **Face Recognition:** 
    - **Objective:** To identify or verify a person by comparing and analyzing patterns based on the person's facial features.
    - **Functionality:** It uses the results from the face detection phase and further processes the detected faces to determine the identity of the individuals. This typically involves feature extraction and matching against a database of known faces.
    - **Use Cases:** Access control, user authentication, tagging people in photos on social media, and personalized user experiences.

This project focuses primarily on the **face recognition** aspect, aiming to accurately identify individuals based on their facial features.
